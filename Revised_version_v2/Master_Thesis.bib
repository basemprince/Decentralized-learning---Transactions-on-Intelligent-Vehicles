	abstract = {Generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) studies have grown exponentially in the past few years. Their impact has been seen mainly in the computer vision field with realistic image and video manipulation, especially generation, making significant advancements. While these computer vision advances have garnered much attention, {GAN} applications have diversified across disciplines such as time series and sequence generation. As a relatively new niche for {GANs}, fieldwork is ongoing to develop high quality, diverse and private time series data. In this paper, we review {GAN} variants designed for time series related applications. We propose a taxonomy of discrete-variant {GANs} and continuous-variant {GANs}, in which {GANs} deal with discrete time series and continuous time series data. Here we showcase the latest and most popular literature in this field; their architectures, results, and applications. We also provide a list of the most popular evaluation metrics and their suitability across applications. Also presented is a discussion of privacy measures for these {GANs} and further protections and directions for dealing with sensitive data. We aim to frame clearly and concisely the latest and state-of-the-art research in this area and their applications to real-world technologies.},

	url = {https://odr.chalmers.se/handle/20.500.12380/302525},
	abstract = {Data, in this new hybrid era, is the driving force for many industries. The automotive 
industry is no exception to this, and the industry has seen an increasing reliance 
on data for its operations. The automotive sector, nowadays, offers more services 
than just selling a vehicle. It now provides complete mobility solutions like connected, 
shared, and autonomous electric vehicles with personalized options. Such 
services are possible only with the use of high quality data. Manual data collection 
from automobiles is an expensive and laborious task, due to which only a sparse 
amount of high quality data is collected. Reduced data means that the operations 
and analysis performed are also limited, which makes the company able to offer 
less services to the customers. One solution to increase the data is to generate it 
synthetically using deep neural networks. 
Though there are many methods to generate data synthetically, most of them have 
limitations on developing diverse data and preserving the temporal dynamics of the 
original data. This thesis focuses on those issues and studies the possibility of designing 
a neural network model to generate varied time-series data which has the 
characteristics of the original data. In this thesis, a Generative Adversarial Network 
({GAN}) is implemented to synthetically generate time-series data. 
A conventional method of building a machine learning model from scratch is followed 
in this thesis, after weighing several factors. The relevant training data is collected 
from the vehicle and then pre-processed to improve the quality of the data. Following 
this, an initial {GAN} model is developed that contains the generator and 
discriminator structure. Then, an enhanced model with supervised learning mechanism 
called {timeGAN} model is developed for achieving more realistic synthetic 
data. This model is then evaluated with suitable metrics, both in a qualitative and 
quantitative manner. The thesis aims to resolve the issue of scarce data and thus, 
paves the way for effective predictive maintenance of vehicles and better services to 
the customers.},

The generator function is explicitly constructed such that the induced stochastic process allows a transition to its risk-neutral distribution. Our numerical results highlight that distributional properties for small and large lags are in an excellent agreement and dependence properties such as volatility clusters, leverage effects, and serial autocorrelations can be generated by the generator function of Quant {GANs}, demonstrably in high fidelity.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12999},
	abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}) are a powerful class of generative models in the deep learning community. Current practice on large-scale {GAN} training utilizes large models and distributed large-batch training strategies, and is implemented on deep learning frameworks (e.g., {TensorFlow}, {PyTorch}, etc.) designed in a centralized manner. In the centralized network topology, every worker needs to either directly communicate with the central node or indirectly communicate with all other workers in every iteration. However, when the network bandwidth is low or network latency is high, the performance would be significantly degraded. Despite recent progress on decentralized algorithms for training deep neural networks, it remains unclear whether it is possible to train {GANs} in a decentralized manner. The main difficulty lies at handling the nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization and the decentralized communication simultaneously. In this paper, we address this difficulty by designing the {\textbackslash}textbf\{first gradient-based decentralized parallel algorithm\} which allows workers to have multiple rounds of communications in one iteration and to update the discriminator and generator simultaneously, and this design makes it amenable for the convergence analysis of the proposed decentralized algorithm. Theoretically, our proposed decentralized algorithm is able to solve a class of non-convex non-concave min-max problems with provable non-asymptotic convergence to first-order stationary point. Experimental results on {GANs} demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The network is trained in a sequence-to-sequence fashion where we condition the output from the model on sequences describing the surrounding environment. This enables the model to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, and the model is used to generate synthetic time series describing the errors in a production sensor which can be used for more realistic simulations. The model is trained on a data set collected from real roads with various trafﬁc settings, and yields signiﬁcantly better results as compared to previous works.},

Although federated learning shows significant promise as a key approach when data cannot be shared or centralized, current methods show limited privacy properties and have shortcomings when applied to common real-world scenarios, especially when client data is heterogeneous. In this paper, we propose an alternative method to learn a personalized model for each client in a federated setting, with greater generalization abilities than previous methods. To achieve this personalization we propose a federated learning framework using a mixture of experts to combine the specialist nature of a locally trained model with the generalist knowledge of a global model. We evaluate our method on a variety of datasets with different levels of data heterogeneity, and our results show that the mixture of experts model is better suited as a personalized model for devices in these settings, outperforming both fine-tuned global models and local specialists.},

Therefore, in this work we study the problem of how to efficiently learn a model in a peer-to-peer system with non-iid client data. We propose a method named Performance-Based Neighbor Selection ({PENS}) where clients with similar data distributions detect each other and cooperate by evaluating their training losses on each other's data to learn a model suitable for the local data distribution.

	abstract = {Generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) are emerging machine learning models for generating synthesized data similar to real data by jointly training a generator and a discriminator. In many applications, data and computational resources are distributed over many devices, so centralized computation with all data in one location is infeasible due to privacy and/or communication constraints. This paper proposes a new framework for training {GANs} in a distributed fashion: Each device computes a local discriminator using local data; a single server aggregates their results and computes a global {GAN}. Specifically, in each iteration, the server sends the global {GAN} to the devices, which then update their local discriminators; the devices send their results to the server, which then computes their average as the global discriminator and updates the global generator accordingly. Two different update schedules are designed with different levels of parallelism between the devices and the server. Numerical results obtained using three popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can outperform a state-of-the-art framework in terms of convergence speed.},

	abstract = {Generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) have shown great success in deep representations learning, data generation, and security enhancement. With the development of the Internet of Things, 5th generation wireless systems (5G), and other technologies, the large volume of data collected at the edge of networks provides a new way to improve the capabilities of {GANs}. Due to privacy, bandwidth, and legal constraints, it is not appropriate to upload all the data to the cloud or servers for processing. Therefore, this article focuses on deploying and training {GANs} at the edge rather than converging edge data to the central node. To address this problem, we designed a novel distributed learning architecture for {GANs}, called {DANCE}. {DANCE} can adaptively perform communication compression based on the available bandwidth, while supporting both data and model parallelism training of {GANs}. In addition, inspired by the gossip mechanism and Stackelberg game, a compatible algorithm, {AC}-{GAN} is proposed. The theoretical analysis guarantees the convergence of the model and the existence of approximate equilibrium in {AC}-{GAN}. Both simulation and prototype system experiments show that {AC}-{GAN} can achieve better training effectiveness with less communication overhead than the {SOTA} algorithms, i.e., {FL}-{GAN} and {MD}-{GAN}.},

	abstract = {Generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) are a framework for producing a generative model by way of a two-player minimax game. In this paper, we propose the {\textbackslash}emph\{Generative Multi-Adversarial Network\} ({GMAN}), a framework that extends {GANs} to multiple discriminators. In previous work, the successful training of {GANs} requires modifying the minimax objective to accelerate training early on. In contrast, {GMAN} can be reliably trained with the original, untampered objective. We explore a number of design perspectives with the discriminator role ranging from formidable adversary to forgiving teacher. Image generation tasks comparing the proposed framework to standard {GANs} demonstrate {GMAN} produces higher quality samples in a fraction of the iterations when measured by a pairwise {GAM}-type metric.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) has proven hugely successful. Regular {GANs} hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks ({LSGANs}) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator. We show that minimizing the objective function of {LSGAN} yields minimizing the Pearson \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ divergence. There are two benefits of {LSGANs} over regular {GANs}. First, {LSGANs} are able to generate higher quality images than regular {GANs}. Second, {LSGANs} perform more stable during the learning process. We evaluate {LSGANs} on five scene datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by {LSGANs} are of better quality than the ones generated by regular {GANs}. We also conduct two comparison experiments between {LSGANs} and regular {GANs} to illustrate the stability of {LSGANs}.},

We show how to construct complex behaviors by re-using elementary neural network building blocks that can be trained and tested extensively; one of our goals is to mitigate the “black box” and verifiability issues that affect end-to-end trained networks. By structuring complex behaviors within a subsumption architecture, we retain the ability to learn (mostly at motor primitives level) with the ability to create complex behaviors by subsuming the (well-known) learned elementary perception-action loops. The learning process itself is simplified, since the agent needs only to learn elementary behaviors. At the same time, the structure imposed with the subsumption architecture ensures that the agent behaves in predictable ways (e.g., treating all obstacles uniformly). We demonstrate these ideas for longitudinal obstacle avoidance behavior, but the proposed approach can also be adapted to other situations.},

We unify the above phenomena by defining a new complexity measure we call the effective model complexity and conjecture a generalized double descent with respect to this measure. Furthermore, our notion of model complexity allows us to identify certain regimes where increasing (even quadrupling) the number of train samples actually hurts test performance.},

Using variants of the asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm we study the impact of synchronization protocol, stale gradient updates, minibatch size, learning rates, and number of learners on runtime performance and model accuracy. We introduce a new learning rate modulation strategy to counter the effect of stale gradients and propose a new synchronization protocol that can effectively bound the staleness in gradients, improve runtime performance and achieve good model accuracy. Our empirical investigation reveals a principled approach for distributed training of neural networks: the mini-batch size per learner should be reduced as more learners are added to the system to preserve the model accuracy. We validate this approach using commonly-used image classification benchmarks: {CIFAR}10 and {ImageNet}.},

However, such datasets are often small, making the training of deep neural network architectures ineffective. For time-series, the suite of data augmentation tricks we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need to maintain the basic properties of the signal. Data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network ({GAN}) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool. {RNN}-based {GANs} suffer from the fact that they cannot effectively model long sequences of data points with irregular temporal relations. To tackle these problems, we introduce {TTS}-{GAN}, a transformer-based {GAN} which can successfully generate realistic synthetic time-series data sequences of arbitrary length, similar to the real ones. Both the generator and discriminator networks of the {GAN} model are built using a pure transformer encoder architecture. We use visualizations and dimensionality reduction techniques to demonstrate the similarity of real and generated time-series data. We also compare the quality of our generated data with the best existing alternative, which is an {RNN}-based time-series {GAN}.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on {ImageNet} classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

	abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}) excel at creating realistic images with complex models for which maximum likelihood is infeasible. However, the convergence of {GAN} training has still not been proved. We propose a two time-scale update rule ({TTUR}) for training {GANs} with stochastic gradient descent on arbitrary {GAN} loss functions. {TTUR} has an individual learning rate for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic approximation, we prove that the {TTUR} converges under mild assumptions to a stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For the evaluation of the performance of {GANs} at image generation, we introduce the "Fr{\textbackslash}'echet Inception Distance" ({FID}) which captures the similarity of generated images to real ones better than the Inception Score. In experiments, {TTUR} improves learning for {DCGANs} and Improved Wasserstein {GANs} ({WGAN}-{GP}) outperforming conventional {GAN} training on {CelebA}, {CIFAR}-10, {SVHN}, {LSUN} Bedrooms, and the One Billion Word Benchmark.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07284},
	shorttitle = {{TranAD}},
	abstract = {Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time-series data is of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose {TranAD}, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attention-based sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. {TranAD} uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability. Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning ({MAML}) allows us to train the model using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that {TranAD} can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient training. Specifically, {TranAD} increases F1 scores by up to 17\%, reducing training times by up to 99\% compared to the baselines.},
